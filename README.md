# Language Translator

This project was to teach me how to use objects, arrays, for loops and to practice on functions. I was required to choose 3 different languages and translate some holiday words (at least 6 per language) from one language to another. I chose Hungarian, Gaelic (the Scottish version) and Finnish. All of these translate to English. It was a good practice of using the PrintToDom as well. 

# How to run this project

1. Use npm to install http-server in your terminal if you have not already:
```
npm install -g http-server
```

2. Run the server: 
```
hs -p 9999
```
3. Open Chrome and navigate to:
```
localhost:9999
```

- All you need to do is type in a holiday word in English to see if it will translate in one of the 3 listed above. If they do not exist in the bank of words, an alert will appear and tell you so. If it is, the word will be translated below.
